	not impersonate someone else<br> The community allows you to create a profile and establish your identity as a

	or entity.<br> <br> Please do not:<br> <br> Impersonate another individual or company;<br> Intentionally use a

	users’ integrity and safety.<br> <br> Each of us is an important part of the EmojART Community. If you see something
	that you think may violate our<br> guidelines, please help us by flagging the emoji art as inappropriate or writing
	to us at navonapps@outlook.com.<br> <br> When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as
	possible - such as the emojiArt itself and the<br> author name of the content - so we can find and review it
	quickly. We may remove entire posts if either the imagery or<br> associated captions violate our guidelines.<br>
	<br> Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between EmojART users. If one of your creations
	was posted<br> by someone else, you could try contacting the violator directly and ask for the content to be taken
	down. If that<br> doesn’t work, you can file a copyright report.<br> <br> We may work with law enforcement,
	including when we believe that there’s a risk of physical harm or threat to public<br> safety.<br><br>
