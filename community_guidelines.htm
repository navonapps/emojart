EmojART Community Guidelines
Last Updated: March 19, 2020

Our vision is to make emoji art accessible to all. To help advance this, we’ve developed the EmojART Community to enable
people from around the world to share and discover creative emoji art. Please help us build a high-quality, inclusive
community by ensuring your work follows these Community Guidelines and reporting any violations.

By publishing your emoji art, you agree to these Community Guidelines, as well as ourterms of service. We’re committed
to these Community Guidelines, and we hope you are too. Your continued use of the EmojART Community will indicate your
acceptance of the changes.

EmojART reserves the right to remove an emoji art at any time. Overstepping any of the following boundaries may result
in removed content, disabled accounts, or other restrictions.

Appeals: If you have any questions about the Community Guidelines - or believe that your listing was removed incorrectly
- please contact us at navonapps@outlook.com.

Community Guidelines
I will respect the intellectual property rights of others
The EmojART Community is a place to share your own work with other EmojART users.

As always, you retain your ownership rights in the content you post on the EmojART Community
We believe that allowing others to use work with attribution can be an effective marketing tool for publishers. All work
will be published and available to the community under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY
4.0).
When using work from the EmojART Community, please follow the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International license (CC BY 4.0) license.
Please do not upload other people's work to your own profile or create confusion about who originally authored any work.
Please do not duplicate another user’s work and republish to the Community without meaningful modification or
alteration. Remixing and publishing the work of others in the Community is permitted but only with meaningful
modification or alteration by you, as well as attribution.
Please respect the intellectual property rights of others and do not post anything that you don’t have the rights to
post.


I will not post inappropriate content
We are building a welcoming and inclusive community. EmojART retains full discretion to remove any content that is not
appropriate.

Depictions of minors in a sexual manner
Hate speech or highly offensive language
Harassment or threats
Graphic violence
Illegal activities or goods or promotion of illegal activities or goods

If you notice any content that violates the above guidelines, please help flagging the content as inappropriate or
report it to us at navonapps@outlook.com.

I will not post spam
Please do not use the ability to create a profile or publish content to spam EmojART users. This EmojART Community is
meant to be a platform for EmojART users to learn and share ideas and emoji arts with one another. Content that we deem
spammy will be removed.

Do not post advertisements; and
Do not link to spammy websites
I will not violate someone’s privacy
We want everyone to feel safe and comfortable participating in the EmojART Community. Please ensure that your published
content does not contain someone else’s personal information.

Please do not post content that has someone else’s:

Phone number
Private email addresses
Physical addresses
Credit card/social security info
Passwords

I will give credit for inspiration
Creating work inspired by someone or something else is natural and expected. Please make sure to give credit when
posting content that is inspired by another member’s work. And please remember, attribution is a requirement of the
Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license ( CC BY 4.0), which governs the work made available through the
EmojART Community.

If you believe your work has been posted to the EmojART Community without your consent, please contact us at
navonapps@outlook.com.

Please do not duplicate another user’s work and republish to the Community without meaningful modification or
alteration. Remixing and publishing the work of others in the Community is permitted but only with meaningful
modification or alteration by you, as well as attribution.

I will not impersonate someone else
The community allows you to create a profile and establish your identity as a creator. To maintain trust and
authenticity, we will disable accounts that attempt to impersonate another person or entity.

Please do not:

Impersonate another individual or company;
Intentionally use a deceptively similar username or avatar;
Post misleading or false employment information; or
Falsely attribute someone else's work.
Report a violation
Help us keep the EmojART Community strong and protect our users’ integrity and safety.

Each of us is an important part of the EmojART Community. If you see something that you think may violate our
guidelines, please help us by flagging the emoji art as inappropriate or writing to us at navonapps@outlook.com.

When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible - such as the emojiArt itself and the
author name of the content - so we can find and review it quickly. We may remove entire posts if either the imagery or
associated captions violate our guidelines.

Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between EmojART users. If one of your creations was posted
by someone else, you could try contacting the violator directly and ask for the content to be taken down. If that
doesn’t work, you can file a copyright report.

We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s a risk of physical harm or threat to public
safety.
